# Cyclistic-2019-Data
#### Google Data Analytics Capstone Project

# Intro
In this project I will perform real-world tasks of a junior data analyst working at the fictional company, Cyclistic. I will follow the steps of the data analysis process: **Ask**, **Prepare**, **Process**, **Analyse**, **Share**, and **Act**.

# Goal
The goal of this analysis is to **understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently**. With this information the team can design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. 

## Ask 
- How do casual riders and annual members use cyclisitc differently
- What benefits would incentivise casual riders to buy annual memberships?
- Is there a difference in the type of bike used by casual vs. annual members?
- What is the peak time of year for bike use?

## Prepare
The data has been made available by Motivate International Inc. and is available [here.](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html) The data has been organised into smaller time periods, however, I will aim to analyse an entire year in order to see seasonal trends in the data. The user license agreement is available to view [here.](https://divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement) 

The data will showcase a year of Cyclistic user activity an hopefully paint a clear picture of the differences between its users.

## Process 
The data was stored on an SSD and analysed using R Studio
